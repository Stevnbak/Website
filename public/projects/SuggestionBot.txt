A discord suggestion bot.

The discord suggestion bot I developed when the one we previously used experienced a lot of trouble.
It uses purely discord application interactions to simplify the creation of and voting on suggestions.
It was used in the official The Cycle Frontier discord server with more than 200k members, until the game was shut down.
The bot was made in NodeJs using the discord.js module.
The bot can be added to any server by going here: [Invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1096155944469143562&permissions=2147535872&scope=bot)
