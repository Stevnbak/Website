Discord;Bot;Solo;Javascript;NodeJs
A discord moderation bot.

The moderation bot I developed after being annoyed by one of the most popular moderation bots, Dyno.
It uses purely discord application interactions to simplify the moderation actions and logging.
The bot was made in nodeJs using the discord.js module version 14.
The bot can be added to any server by going to this link: [Invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=998213943942193152&permissions=1376604179664&scope=applications.commands%20bot)
