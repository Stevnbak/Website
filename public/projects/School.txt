The different programming projects I've made during my time in upper secondary highschool (Danish HTX).

|DDU|
DDU or Digital Design and Development is a class I have in school. 
It is mostly targeted towards beginners and the projects are therefore quite simple.
All of these projects were made in a group.

**Games made:**
- [DDU 2D Game](https://github.com/Stevnbak/DDU-Spil-September)
    This was the first, and currently only game, I've made in DDU. It is a simple platformer where you have to hunt invasive species. It was made in a team of 3 and includes saving and loading saves and progress along with the gameplay.
    It was developed using the Processing language, which is based on Java, and using SQLite for the database.
- [DDU School Test IT-System](https://github.com/DDU-FKMO/DDU-Mini-Projekt)
    This is a website and database for a school test system. It was made in a team of 4 and includes a login system, a database for storing the test results and a website for the teachers to see the results and students for completing the tests. 
    The website can no longer be accessed online, but the code is still available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DDU-FKMO/DDU-Mini-Projekt)
- [DDU Machine Learning](https://github.com/DDU-FKMO/Racerbil_MachineLearning)
    This is an application to try and use neural networks and genetic algorithms to achieve machine learning with racing cars going around a track. 
    It was also developed using the Processing language and in a group of 2.
- [DDU Training Tracker](https://github.com/DDU-FKMO/DDU-Eksamensprojekt)
    This is an application for tracking exercises and has training programs, logging sessions, statistics, unlocks, level, achievements.
    The website was made using Nodejs, Vue and MongoDB.
    The website can be accessed by going to [test.stevnbak.dk](https://test.stevnbak.dk/)
    This was our final project and also the biggest one in this class, and was made in a group of 4.


|Programmering C|
This is a class I have in school which is focused on programming in C#. It is also targeted towards beginners and the projects are therefore also quite simple. 
All of these projects were made by me alone.

**Projects made:**
- [Ticket System](https://github.com/Stevnbak/ProgC-CinemaTicketSystem)
    This is a simple ticket system for a cinema. It was made by me alone as a Console App in C#.
- [Quiz Website](https://github.com/Stevnbak/ProgC-BlazorQuiz)
    This is a simple website to take a quiz, it uses an [API](https://opentdb.com/) to retrieve questions and answers, which allows the user to try many categories and get many different questions each time.
- [Carcassonne](https://github.com/Stevnbak/ProgC-Carcassonne)
    This is a website made in Blazor using C# as my final project for the class. It is a web version of the board game "Carcassonne".

|Rubik's Cube Solver|
This is a program i made in relation to a big written assignment in the subjects math and programming about how to solve a Rubik's Cube with the fewest rotations possible.
The written assignment was written in danish, but the code is commented in english and made using C#.
The program source code can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/Stevnbak/RubiksCubeSolver)
