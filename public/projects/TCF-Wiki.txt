The official community wiki for The Cycle: Frontier made with Mediawiki.

[https://thecyclefrontier.wiki](https://thecyclefrontier.wiki)

Together with my friend we moved the community wiki away from fandom, because of various problems with how fandom functions and decided to create and host the wiki ourselves. 
This was done using mediawiki and an ubuntu server. We have since joined a team of wiki projects (ABXY wikis) and the wiki are now hosted and backend maintained by them.

*[The Cycle: Frontier](https://thecycle.game) is a free-to-play, open-world, post-apocalyptic, survival game set in a world where the sun has stopped shining. The game is being developed by [YAGER](https://yager.de).*
